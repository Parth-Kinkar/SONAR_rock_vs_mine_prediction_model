# Sonar Rock vs. Mine Prediction with Logistic Regression
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine. The model utilizes logistic regression and is built using Python.

## Project Goal

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify objects in sonar data as either rocks or mines. This has applications in areas like marine exploration and defense where identifying underwater objects is crucial.

## Data

The project leverages the Sonar dataset, which is a publicly available dataset containing features extracted from sonar signals bounced off underwater objects. This dataset is typically included in the repository or downloaded separately (mention source if applicable).

## Model

This project employs logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm. The model is trained on the sonar data, learning to distinguish between rocks and mines based on the extracted features.
## Getting Started

This project requires the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
You can install them using pip:
```
$ pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
$ Project Structure:
```
* `data/`: This folder contains the diabetes dataset (replace with your data source).
* `notebooks/`: This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation (modify names if needed).
* `models/`: This folder will store the trained model files after running the notebooks.
* `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required Python libraries.
## Running the Notebooks:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Start a Jupyter Notebook server:
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open the notebooks in `notebooks/` and run the cells sequentially.
The first notebook might perform data loading, cleaning, and pre-processing.
The second notebook will likely train the SVM model and evaluate its performance.
## Further Considerations:

This is a basic example, and you might want to explore hyperparameter tuning for the SVM model.
Consider adding functionalities for saving and loading the trained model for future predictions.
